# About Project
"I developed a task management application utilizing React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and SQL for database management. The application allows users to create tasks with titles and descriptions, with a default status of 'incomplete.' This project showcases my proficiency in full-stack development, including front-end design, server-side logic, and database integration."


# To run the project locally, follow these instructions:

**1. Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/Kashifraza1208/task-management-app.git**

Note : If unable to clone the repository, can be conveniently downloaded the project as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it to access the source code.

**2. For Start the project** -

**For frontend (inside frontend directory)=====>**
step-1 `npm install`
step-2 `npm start`

**For backend(In main directory)=====>**
step-1 `npm install`
step-2 `npm start`

**3. Last step - Add config.env file in this directory backend/config/config.env.**
config.env

`PORT`,
`NODE_ENV`
`HOST`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
